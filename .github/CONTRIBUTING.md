## Development

Development requires [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a dependency management system.

```
pip install poetry
```

The `make install` command resolves and installs the dependencies.

```
make install
```

Before making a pull request, run `make format` and make sure `make check` succeeds.

```
make format
make check
```
